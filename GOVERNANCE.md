## 1. Technical Steering Committee (TSC)

**Scope & Responsibilities** (high-level)
- Coordinates technical direction, approves proposals, organizes/removes subprojects, creates SIGs/WGs, appoints representatives, sets community norms and workflows.

**Membership Changes**
- Propose via PR to [TSC/tsc-rollups.md](./TSC/tsc-rollups.md) using the nomination/removal templates there.
- Approval: simple majority of voting TSC members participating in the vote.
- Inactivity > 6 months may trigger a removal vote.

**Decision Making**
- Consensus-seeking. If no consensus, call a vote; simple majority passes.

## 2. Governing Board

**Scope & Responsibilities** (high-level)
- Founding partners hold permanent seats; the TSC elects one representative.
- Voting, quorum, and admission of new members follow board rules.

**Membership List**
- Maintained in [Board/board-rollups.md](./Board/board-rollups.md).

**Admission of New Members**
- Non-founding partners require nomination and board majority acceptance after demonstrating sustained commitment.

## 3. SIGs & Working Groups (WGs)

- Anyone may propose a SIG (long-term) or WG (short-term) via PR that creates a directory for the SIG/WG and a README based on the template in `prototypes/`.
- SIGs/WGs operate transparently in the open; scope and deliverables should be tracked in GitHub.

## 4. Standards / RFD Process

- Technical change proposals use an open “Request for Discussion (RFD)” process in the roadmap/issues tracker.
- Discussions occur transparently; decisions recorded in issues/PRs.

- Follows Contributor Covenant v2.0; any local changes are documented in our Code of Conduct.
