## Contributing

All development of OpenCHAMI takes place in public in this GitHub Organization.

* We report on our progress to the OpenCHAMI Board through our [Roadmap Project](https://github.com/orgs/OpenCHAMI/projects/1)
* We review issues daily based on recent updates. [Recently Updated Issues](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AOpenCHAMI++&type=issues&state=open&s=updated&o=desc)
* We review the open pull requests daily. [Recently Updated PRs](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AOpenCHAMI++&type=pullrequests&s=updated&o=desc&state=open)

All repositories in the OpenCHAMI github organization share the same [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [code of conduct](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which can both be found in the organization's [.github](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/.github) repository.

General Development Ideas are tracked in our [roadmap](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/roadmap) repository.  To get a common view of active development across all repositories, review the main [Roadmap Project](https://github.com/orgs/OpenCHAMI/projects/1).  Development issues from all repositories should be linked there for easy collaboration.

We welcome feedback and PRs from the community!
