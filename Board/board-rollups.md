## Board Membership Rules

### Governing Board (Board Of Directors) 

Membership on the board is granted permanently to the founding institutions and one representative from the Technical Steering Committee (the TSC). A founding institution is required to submit in writing to the board its intention to leave the project or the board. Each founding institution and the TSC is granted one vote on the board. Each founding institution appoints a representative and one alternate member. The TSC will be required to send one member to attend all board activities. The board shall define in these rules the mechanism by which members of the board will be accepted and removed. Unless otherwise stipulated, votes are carried by a simple majority of voting members.

### Board Membership

The Board comprises members nominated by the founding partners and non-founding partners that fulfill the membership criteria.

Each founding partner must nominate one primary and one alternate Board member. Both individuals have the right to attend board meetings, but only the primary Board member has voting rights, unless the primary member is unavailable.


**Voting & Quorum**  
- Quorum: 50% of voting members.  
- Simple majority approves routine motions.  
- ⅔ required for budget, Charter changes, or dissolution.  
- Conflict resolution: unresolved conflicts may be escalated to LF Projects staff (projects@linuxfoundation.org).  

**Admission of New Members**  
- Non-founding partners must demonstrate sustained commitment (≥6 months of resources delivered).  
- They must be nominated by an existing partner and accepted by majority vote of the Board.  
- New partners may nominate one primary and one alternate Board member.  
- There are no non-voting members; all Board members have equal vote.
