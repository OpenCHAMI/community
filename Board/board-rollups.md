- Simple majority approves routine motions.  
- ⅔ required for budget, Charter changes, or dissolution.  
- Conflict resolution: unresolved conflicts may be escalated to LF Projects staff (projects@linuxfoundation.org).  

**Admission of New Members**  
- Non-founding partners must demonstrate sustained commitment (≥6 months of resources delivered).  
- They must be nominated by an existing partner and accepted by majority vote of the Board.  
- New partners may nominate one primary and one alternate Board member.
