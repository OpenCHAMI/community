# Governance of the OpenCHAMI Project
_Last updated: August 2025_

This file describes the current governance of the OpenCHAMI Project. 
In accordance with the [charter](/Charter.md), the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is responsible for technical guidance of the project.

## 1. Technical Leadership

### 1.1 Technical Steering Committee (TSC)

| Role | Incumbent | Term | Selection |
|------|-----------|------|-----------|
| **TSC Lead** | [Alex Lovell‑Troy](https://github.com/alexlovelltroy) | Apr 2025 – Mar 2026 | Elected annually by TSC simple‑majority vote |


Role: As stated in the [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md), the TSC lead acts as a bridge between the TSC and the Board. To effectively guide the project, the lead must stay informed about major issues, the project roadmap, and priorities of consortium partners. They are expected to help guide decisions in ways that are technically sound and responsive to community needs.

#### 1.1.1 TSC Members

See [tsc rollups](/TSC/tsc-rollups.md) for current membership.


#####  Adding / Removing TSC Members
* Any contributor may self‑nominate or be nominated via a pull request to [community/TSC repo](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/community/tree/main/TSC/tsc-rollups.md).  
* Approval by existing TSC members requires **simple majority** of those voting.  
* Persistent inactivity (defined as no participation for over 6 months) may trigger a removal vote.

#### 1.1.2 Decision‑Making
The TSC follows a **consensus‑seeking model**: Please refer to the [charter](/Charter.md).
1. Discussion on GitHub Issues / PRs or in scheduled TSC calls.  
2. Rough consensus is assumed unless objections are raised.  
3. If consensus cannot be reached, a vote is called; decisions pass with **simple majority** (> 50 %).

## 2. Governing Board (Board Of Directors) 

Membership on the board is granted permanently to the founding institutions and one representative from the Technical Steering Committee (the TSC). A founding institution is required to submit in writing to the board (via the board mailing list) its intention to leave the project or the board. Each founding institution is granted one vote on the board, as is the TSC. Each founding institution appoints a representative and one alternate member. The TSC will be required to send one member to attend all board activities. The board shall define in these rules the mechanism by which members of the board will be accepted and removed. Unless otherwise stipulated, votes are carried by a simple majority of voting members.

### 2.1 Board Membership

The Board comprises members selected by the partners that fulfill the membership criteria.

Each partner must nominate one primary and one alternate Board member. Both individuals have the right to attend board meetings, but only one member may cast a vote on behalf of a partner.

There can be no non-voting members of the Board. All Board members have an equal vote.

### 2.2 Composition

See [board rollups](/Board/board-rollups.md) for current membership.

### 2.3 Voting & Quorum
* **Quorum:** 50 % of voting members.  
* **Simple majority** approves routine motions; **⅔** required for budget, Charter changes, or dissolution.
* **Conflict resolution:** Conflicts unresolved through voting can be escalated to LF Projects staff at [projects@linuxfoundation.org](mailto:projects@linuxfoundation.org).



### 2.4 Admission of New Members

New members may be added to the project through nomination by an existing partner and majority vote of the board.  Board and TSC representatives of new members may participate in any meetings held after the admission of a new partner.

## 3. Special Interest Groups (SIGs) & Working Groups (WGs)

It is the responsibility of the TSC to organize SIGs and temporary working groups to address technical issues based on the needs of the community.  Any project participant may suggest a SIG for long term focus or a working group for a short term project through a pull request to the community repository that creates a directory for the SIG and a readme based on the [prototype](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/community/blob/main/prototypes/sig-README-template.md).


---

## 4. Technical Standards Process

The TSC ensures the quality of technical changes. Discussions occur transparently in the repository under [RFDs](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/roadmap/issues), modeled after practices from the [IETF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3) and [Oxide](https://oxide.computer/blog/rfd-1-requests-for-discussion).

**Currently, the project is evaluating whether to adopt a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) or a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). A formal decision will be documented here once finalized.**

## 5. Community Values

See **[Values Document](values.md)** for the principles that guide our collaboration.

## 6. Code of Conduct

The OpenCHAMI project follows version 2.0 of the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html) with any changes noted locally in our own [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## 8. Communication

OpenCHAMI primarily uses [Slack](https://openchami.slack.com) for community discussions and real-time communication. Technical discussions, proposals, and **Requests for Discussion (RFDs)** occur on [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/roadmap/issues). Community members are encouraged to join the [OpenCHAMI Slack workspace](https://openchami.slack.com) and actively participate in discussions and decision-making processes.
