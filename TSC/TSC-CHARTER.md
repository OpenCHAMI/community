## Technical Steering Committee (TSC)  
The **Technical Steering Committee (TSC)** will be responsible for all technical oversight of the open source Project.  

- The TSC voting members are initially the Project’s **Committers**.  
- At the inception of the project, the Committers of the Project will be as set forth within the *CONTRIBUTING* file within the Project’s code repository.  
- The TSC may choose an alternative approach for determining the voting members of the TSC, and any such alternative approach will be documented in the *CONTRIBUTING* file.  
- Any meetings of the TSC are intended to be **open to the public** and can be conducted electronically, via teleconference, or in person.  

### Roles within the TSC  
TSC projects generally involve **Contributors** and **Committers**. The TSC may adopt or modify roles, documented in the *CONTRIBUTING* file.  

- **Contributors**: Anyone in the technical community that contributes code, documentation, or other technical artifacts to the Project.  
- **Committers**: Contributors who have earned the ability to modify (“commit”) source code, documentation, or other technical artifacts in a project’s repository.  
- A **Contributor** may become a **Committer** by a majority approval of the existing Committers.  
- A **Committer** may be removed by a majority approval of the other existing Committers.  

Participation in the Project through becoming a Contributor and Committer is **open to anyone** so long as they abide by the terms of this Charter.  

### Responsibilities of the TSC  
The TSC will oversee all aspects of the Project, including:  

- Coordinating the technical direction of the Project.  
- Approving project or system proposals (e.g., incubation, deprecation, scope changes).  
- Organizing and removing sub-projects.  
- Creating sub-committees or working groups for cross-project issues.  
- Appointing representatives to work with other open source or open standards communities.  
- Establishing community norms, workflows, and security issue reporting policies.  
- Approving and implementing contribution policies (*to be published in the CONTRIBUTING file*).  
- Coordinating with the Series Manager to resolve matters as set forth in Section 7.  
- Managing project-related marketing, events, and communications.  

## TSC Voting  
The Project aims to operate as a **consensus-based** community. If a vote is required:  

- Each TSC voting member has **one vote**.  
- **Quorum** requires at least **50% of all voting members**.  
- Decisions at a meeting require a **majority vote of those present**, provided quorum is met.  
- Electronic votes require a **majority vote of all voting members**.  
- If a vote cannot be resolved, any voting TSC member may refer the matter to the **Series Manager** for assistance.
